## About Me

I'm Kosmos Werner, and I'm excited to merge my background in architecture with my skills as a self-taught programmer. I hold a bachelor's degree in architecture and urban planning; however, for the past 4 years, I've been delving into the world of programming. I started with C++, then delved into C#, and finally arrived at Python, with a focus on Machine Learning.

## 🚀 My Skills

Here are some of my skills in programming and architecture:

- **Programming Languages**: C++, C# (Winforms, WPF), Python (Machine Learning)
- **Development**: Software Development, Automation Tools, Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Architectural Insight**: I bring a unique perspective from my background as an architect, enriching my approach to programming.
- **Revit**: Experience in using Revit in the fields of Architecture, Structure, and MEP.
- **Dynamo**: Knowledge and experience in using Dynamo to automate tasks and workflows in Revit.
- **Revit API**: Familiarity with the Revit API to customize and extend the capabilities of Revit.

These skills allow me to blend the best of both worlds: architecture and programming, to create innovative and efficient solutions.

## 🌟 Upcoming Projects

I'm excited to share some projects in development that will combine my experience in architecture with my programming skills. Some of the projects you can expect to see in the near future include:

1. 🏙️ **City Growth Projection Project (Python/Jupyter)**: Developing a study entirely in Python with Jupyter that aims to project the growth of a city in 2 years based on the past 8 years. This project utilizes data analysis techniques and Machine Learning to predict urban development.

2. 🌍 **GIS Software for Urban Growth Projection (C#/Python)**: Developing GIS software that will allow managing satellite images and making projections of urban growth. This project will use a combination of C# and Python to provide a versatile and efficient solution.

Stay tuned for these upcoming projects, as I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology and architecture.
