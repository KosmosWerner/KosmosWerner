## üíª About Me

I'm Kosmos Werner, and I'm excited to merge my background in architecture with my self-taught programming skills. I hold a bachelor's degree in architecture and urban planning. However, for the past 4 years, I've been diving into the world of programming. I began with C++, delved into C#, and finally arrived at Python, with a focus on Machine Learning. I also learned web development and JavaScript to use Three.js due to its potential in architectural visualization.

## üöÄ My Skills

Here are some of my skills in programming and architecture:

### Programming Languages
- **C Family**: C, C++, C# (Winforms, WPF), .NET

### Architectural Vision
- I bring a unique perspective from my background in architecture, enriching my approach to programming.

### Specific Software
- Experience in using Revit in the fields of Architecture, Structure, and MEP.
- Knowledge and experience in using Dynamo for automating tasks and workflows in Revit.
- Familiarity with the Revit API to customize and extend Revit's capabilities.

  ![Dynamo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dynamo-red.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Autodesk&logoColor=white)
  ![Revit API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Revit%20API-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Autodesk&logoColor=white)

These skills allow me to blend the best of both worlds: architecture

 and programming, to create innovative and efficient solutions.

## üåü Upcoming Projects

I'm excited to share some ongoing projects that combine my architectural expertise with my programming skills. Some of the projects you can expect to see in the near future include:

- üåç **GIS Software for Urban Growth Projection (C#/Python)**: Developing GIS software that will allow managing satellite images and performing urban growth projections. This project will use a combination of C# and Python to provide a versatile and efficient solution.

Stay tuned for these upcoming projects as I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology and architecture.
